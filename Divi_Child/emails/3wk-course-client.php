Thank you for applying to the <?php echo $course_name; ?> 3-Week program. Admission to this course is by competitive application process. Admission decisions are made by the TLC Board of Directors based on the strength of your application and the overall pool of applicants competing for admission. We expect to make admission decisions about 2 months prior to the start date of the 3-Week session. All admissions decisions are made at the same time, not on a rolling basis. Decisions are made approximately two months prior to the course. Applicants will be notified via e-mail of the boardâ€™s decision (accepted, declined or placed on a waitlist). <br/>
